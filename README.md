# Flight-Fare-Predictor
This project predicts flight prices using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, LGBM, XGBoost, and KNN. It preprocesses data for accuracy and evaluates performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE. A Flask web interface allows users to easily access the flight fare predictions.
